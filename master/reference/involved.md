Calico is an open source project, and we'd love you to get involved.
Whether that might be by reading and participating on our mailing list,
or by diving into the code to propose enhancements or integrate with
other systems. To see the options for getting involved with Calico the
project, please take a look at the following.

## Mailing Lists

Project Calico runs two mailing lists:

-   [calico-announce](http://lists.projectcalico.org/mailman/listinfo/calico-announce_lists.projectcalico.org)
    provides a read-only list providing a regular update on Project
    Calico. Please subscribe so that you can keep up to date on
    the project.
-   [calico-tech](http://lists.projectcalico.org/mailman/listinfo/calico-tech_lists.projectcalico.org)
    provides a list for technical discussions and queries about the
    project. You're welcome to subscribe and to post any Calico-related
    discussion to this list, including problems, ideas, or requirements.

When reporting a problem on calico-tech, please try to:

-   provide a clear subject line
-   provide as much diagnostic information as possible.

That will help us (or anyone else) to answer your question quickly and
correctly.
