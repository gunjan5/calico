title: Calico as a Docker network plugin
---


This tutorial describes how to set up a Calico cluster in a Docker environment
using Docker's native networking framework (built around libnetwork) with
Calico specific network and IPAM drivers.

The libnetwork networking framework is available in Docker in release 1.9 and
above.

Using the Calico network driver, the required network setup and configuration
for networking containers using Calico is handled automatically as part of the
standard network and container lifecycle.  Provided the network is created
using the Calico driver, creating a container using that network will
automatically add the container to the Calico network, creating all necessary
Calico configuration and setting up the interface and routes in the container
accordingly.

The Calico IPAM driver may be used in addition to the the Calico network
driver.  This provides IP address management using the configured Calico IP
Pools as address pools for the container, preferentially selecting sub-blocks
of IPs for a particular host.

## 1. Environment setup

To run through the worked example in this tutorial you will to set up two hosts
with a number of installation dependencies.

Follow the instructions in one of the tutorials below to set up a virtualized
environment using Vagrant or a cloud service - be sure to follow the
appropriate instructions for _Calico as a Docker network plugin_.

- [Vagrant install with CoreOS]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/getting-started/docker/installation/vagrant-coreos/)
- [Vagrant install with Ubuntu]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/getting-started/docker/installation/vagrant-ubuntu)
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/getting-started/docker/installation/aws)
- [Google Compute Engine (GCE)]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/getting-started/docker/installation/gce)
- [DigitalOcean]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/getting-started/docker/installation/digital-ocean)

Altenatively, you can manually configure your hosts.
- [Manual setup]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/getting-started/docker/installation/manual)

If you have everything set up properly you should have `calicoctl` in your
`$PATH`, and two hosts called `calico-01` and `calico-02`.

## 2. Starting Calico services

Once you have your cluster up and running, start calico on all the nodes. The libnetwork plugin will be running inside the calico-node container.

On calico-01

    sudo ETCD_ENDPOINTS=http://<ETCD_IP>:<ETCD_PORT> calicoctl node run

On calico-02

    sudo ETCD_ENDPOINTS=http://<ETCD_IP>:<ETCD_PORT> calicoctl node run

This will start a container on each host. Check they are running

    docker ps

You should see output like this on each node

    vagrant@calico-01:~$ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
    408bd2b9ba53        calico/node:latest   "start_runit"       About an hour ago   Up About an hour                        calico-node

## 3. Create the networks

This worked example creates three Docker networks, where containers on a
particular network are isolated from containers in the other networks.

### 3.1 The Calico IPAM driver

The Calico IPAM driver provides address assignment that is geared towards
a Calico deployment where scaling is important, and port-mapping for the
containers is not required.

The Calico IPAM driver assigns addresses with host aggregation - this is a more
efficient approach for Calico requiring fewer programmed routes.  IPv6
addresses are supported, although with the current Docker API, it is not
possible to have an IPv6-only network, and (unlike the IPv4 behavior) it is
necessary to specify a subnet from which to assign addresses.

When running in a cloud environment we need to also set `ipip` and
`nat-outgoing` options in `ipPool` resource spec in the `yaml` or `json` config file.

### 3.2 Create the network

So, with the Calico IPAM driver configured, we can start creating some networks.

We specify the Calico networking driver (`calico`) when creating the network,
and specify the Calico IPAM driver (`calico-ipam`). Note: `--ipam-driver calico-ipam`
is mandatory when using Calico with Docker libnetwork. 

For this worked example, we explicitly choose a CIDR for each network
rather than using default selections - this is to avoid potential conflicts
with the default NAT IP assignment used by VirtualBox.  Depending on your
specific environment, you may need to choose different CIDRs.

So, once you have decided which type of network to create, following the
appropriate instructions for one of *a)*, *b)*, *c)* or *d)*.

For AWS, omit the `ipip` in the `ipPool` spec below, and `Change Source/Dest. Check` on your instances with
the following EC2 CLI command or by right clicking the instance in the EC2
console, and selecting it from the Networking submenu.

    aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance_id> --source-dest-check "{\"Value\": false}"

#### a) Networking using Calico IPAM in a non-cloud environment

For Calico IPAM in a non-cloud environment, you need to first create a Calico
IP Pool with no additional options.  Here we create a pool with CIDR
192.168.0.0/16.

```
$ cat << EOF | calicoctl create -f -
> - apiVersion: v1
>   kind: ipPool
>   metadata:
>     cidr: 192.168.0.0/16
> EOF
```

To create the networks, run:

    docker network create --driver calico --ipam-driver calico-ipam net1
    docker network create --driver calico --ipam-driver calico-ipam net2
    docker network create --driver calico --ipam-driver calico-ipam net3

#### b) Networking using Calico IPAM in a cloud environment

For Calico IPAM in a cloud environment that doesn't enable direct container to
container communication (DigitalOcean, GCE), you need to first create a Calico
IP Pool using the `calicoctl create` command specifying the `ipip` and
`nat-outgoing` options in the spec. Here we create a pool with CIDR 192.168.0.0/16.

```
$ cat << EOF | calicoctl create -f -
> - apiVersion: v1
>   kind: ipPool
>   metadata:
>     cidr: 192.168.0.0/16
>   spec:
>     ipip:
>       enabled: true
>     nat-outgoing: true
> EOF
```

To create the networks, run:

    docker network create --driver calico --ipam-driver calico-ipam net1
    docker network create --driver calico --ipam-driver calico-ipam net2
    docker network create --driver calico --ipam-driver calico-ipam net3


## 4. Create the workloads in the networks

With the networks created, let's start some containers on each host spread
between these networks.

On calico-01

    docker run --net net1 --name workload-A -tid busybox
    docker run --net net2 --name workload-B -tid busybox
    docker run --net net1 --name workload-C -tid busybox

On calico-02

    docker run --net net3 --name workload-D -tid busybox
    docker run --net net1 --name workload-E -tid busybox

By default, networks are configured so that their members can communicate with
one another, but workloads in other networks cannot reach them.  A, C and E are
all in the same network so should be able to ping each other.  B and D are in
their own networks so shouldn't be able to ping anyone else.

## 5. Validation

On calico-01 check that A can ping C and E.  We can ping workloads within a
containers networks by name.

    docker exec workload-A ping -c 4 workload-C.net1
    docker exec workload-A ping -c 4 workload-E.net1

Also check that A cannot ping B or D.  This is slightly trickier because the
hostnames for different networks will not be added to the host configuration of
the container - so we need to determine the IP addresses assigned to containers
B and D.

Since A and B are on the same host, we can run a single command that inspects
the IP address and issues the ping.  On calico-01

    docker exec workload-A ping -c 4  `docker inspect --format "{% raw %}{{ .NetworkSettings.Networks.net2.IPAddress }}{% endraw %}" workload-B`

These pings will fail.

To test connectivity between A and D which are on different hosts, it is
necessary to run the `docker inspect` command on the host for D (calico-02)
and then run the ping command on the host for A (calico-01).

On calico-02

    docker inspect --format "{% raw %}{{ .NetworkSettings.Networks.net3.IPAddress }}{% endraw %}" workload-D

This returns the IP address of workload-D.

On calico-01

    docker exec workload-A ping -c 4 <IP address of D>

replacing the `<...>` with the appropriate IP address of D.  These pings will
fail.

To see the list of networks, use

    docker network ls

## Assign Static IP when Starting a Container

With the release of Docker 1.10, support has been added to allow users to
configure a specific IP address when creating a container.  In order to use
this feature, Docker requires that you specify the `--subnet` parameter when running
`docker network create`.  This parameter can be used in any of the four **"Create the
network"** sets above.

If you are using the Calico IPAM driver, the `--subnet` value must be the same
CIDR as an existing Calico IP pool.  So if you create a Calico IP pool for
`192.168.1.0/24`, you can use `--subnet=192.168.1.0/24` as a valid subnet.

For example, the following commands:
 - create a Calico IP pool
 - create a Docker network using the IP pool
 - create a container using a specific IP address from the pool

```
$ cat << EOF | calicoctl create -f -
> - apiVersion: v1
>   kind: ipPool
>   metadata:
>     cidr: 192.168.1.0/16
> EOF
```
```
docker network create --driver calico --ipam-driver calico-ipam --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 my_net
```
```
docker run --net my_net --name my_workload --ip 192.168.1.100 -tid busybox
```


## Advanced network policy

If you are using both the Calico network driver and the Calico IPAM driver
it is possible to apply advanced policy to the network.

## Make a container reachable from the Host-Interface (Internet)
If you're interested in using port-forwarding, we have a working example on how
to [expose a container port to the internet]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/usage/external-connectivity)
when using Calico.
